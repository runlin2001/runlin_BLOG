## Introduction
Classic Mechanics to Quantum Mechanics
* Abstraction
* Unpredictable -- no equation to predict, to Update a state, not like a motion problem
* Without ordinary experience -- cannot visualize, cannot see a line, only see a line in a plane, and the plane is imbedded in a 3D space
* Using mathematics to describe

Eg.  
A die : 6 faces  
A coin: 2 sides  

Set  
AND and OR  
AND: Intersection of two set  
OR: union of two set  

Eg.
The easiest system of Quantum Mechanics -- qubit  
qubit is a coin system only has two states  
sigma = 1 or -1  

Apparatus -- black box  
one side up, one window to view  
and a detector for qubit
