## How to run a python program in cmd?

To run a Python program in the command line, you will need to use a command called `python`. Here's an example of how to run a Python program:

1.  Open the Command Prompt on your computer. You can do this by searching for "cmd" in the Start menu on Windows.
    
2.  Navigate to the directory where your Python program is saved. For example, if your program is saved in a folder called "Python" on your C drive, you would type the following command to navigate to that folder:
    
```
cd C:\Python  # maybe in C
```

3.  Once you're in the correct directory, you can run your Python program by typing the following command, followed by the name of your Python file:

```
python program.py
```

In this example, `program.py` is the name of the Python file that you want to run. If your program has a different name, you would replace `program.py` with the name of your file.

Alternatively, you can also use the `py` command to run Python programs. This command is available on newer versions of Windows and can be used instead of the `python` command. For example, you would use the following command to run a Python program called `program.py`:

```
py program.py
```

Keep in mind that you will need to have Python installed on your computer in order to run Python programs in the command line. You can download and install Python from the official Python website.
